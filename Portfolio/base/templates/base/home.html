					<h4>My First Job as a Developer</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>One month into learning python, I think i'm quite aquainted with all the know-hows of the language. Although this framework will take me a lot of practice but once i'll be there you will see this card updated at the earliest.</p>

					<p>My newbie self has now started building stuff using my IT-Vedant learnings which was (honestly speaking) long overdue.</p>

					<p>From this you’ll see that I’m someone that jumps before I can talk myself out of doing something scary.</p>

					<h5>How I Learn</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Reverse Engineer & Build Ugly Prototypes First.</p>

					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.</p>

					<h5>My Short Term Goals</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>Short term goals include learning almost anything the projects throw in my way. Started from Java to now building interesting projects using Django, there's still a long way to go!</p>
				<p>Aside from building small projects I would love to enter a position where I can be part of a bigger team & learn from others with more experience than myself.</p>
